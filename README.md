* openai
* mongodb

Frontend (client):
* tailwindcss
* postcss

##### Use:
1. Go to folder 'server', in terminal run npm i to install dependencies.
2. In folder 'server' is ```.env.example``` file, rename this file to ```.env```  and fill in quotes the datas (from cloudinary and mongodb) needed for environment variables to run the server of application.
**NOTE:** It is necessary to create an account on [cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/) .
3. Run npm run start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:8080/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
4. Go to folder 'client', in terminal run npm i to install dependencies.
5. Run npm run dev for a vite script start. Navigate to http://localhost:5173/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
